 FlASH ABOUT BOX
=================

This project is so very very simplistic... I don't normally stoop to the level of using other people's technology, but Flash is a technology that I'm willing to make exception to simply because it's so good!

Goto www.macromedia.com and download the trial version of Flash 4... (Then d/l the crack... ;)) And basically, this program is what you use to make Flash files... Flash files can contain clickable links to your homepage or other web pages, it can interface with your VB program using the FS command, it fully supports alpha translucency, motion and shape tweening (Position / shape morphing), and loads LOADS -LOADS- more...

The 2 movies used in this simplistic about box are ok, and were made VERY quickly... But the effect is immediate and quite cool!

Have fun peeps!
